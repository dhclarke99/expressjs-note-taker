# Expressjs Note Taker


## Description

This project is a Note Taker application that uses a combination of node.js, express.js and heroku to connect front end user notes and save them to a back end server so that a user can always access their saved notes. 

Building this project provided valuable experience with using express js to connect backend servers and allow data to persist to a user on the front end.
